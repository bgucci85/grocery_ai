# üîç Debugging Guide

The app now includes comprehensive debugging features to help identify and fix selector issues.

## New Debugging Features

### 1. **Automatic Screenshots**

Every time the app tries to add an item (by URL or query), it automatically takes a screenshot and saves it to the project root:

- `debug-barbora-{timestamp}.png` - Product page screenshots for Barbora
- `debug-barbora-search-{timestamp}.png` - Search page screenshots for Barbora
- `debug-rimi-{timestamp}.png` - Product page screenshots for Rimi
- `debug-rimi-search-{timestamp}.png` - Search page screenshots for Rimi

**These screenshots show exactly what the browser sees** when trying to find elements.

### 2. **Enhanced Logging**

When an element can't be found, the app now logs:

- **All buttons on the page** (first 5) with their text content
- **All input elements** (first 10) with their attributes (type, placeholder, name)
- **Which selector successfully found an element** (when successful)

### 3. **Better Selectors**

The drivers now try multiple strategies with site-specific selectors:

**Barbora Button Selectors:**
- `button[class*="b-product-action-add"]`
- `button[class*="product-add"]`
- `button:has-text("ƒÆ krep≈°elƒØ")`
- Plus 10+ generic fallbacks

**Rimi Button Selectors:**
- `button:has-text("Pridƒóti")`
- `button:has-text("ƒÆ krep≈°elƒØ")`
- `button[class*="add-to-cart"]`
- Plus 10+ generic fallbacks

**Search Input Selectors (both sites):**
- 15+ different selector patterns
- Checks placeholder, type, name, class, aria-label, etc.

### 4. **Network Idle Wait**

Pages now wait for `networkidle` (when network is quiet) before looking for elements, with a fallback to `domcontentloaded` if that times out.

## How to Debug Issues

### Step 1: Run with Headful Mode

Enable "Headful mode" so you can see what's happening:

```bash
npm run dev
# Check "Headful mode" checkbox in the UI
```

### Step 2: Check the Live Logs

The UI shows real-time logs with:
- üîµ **[INFO]** - Normal operation
- üü° **[WARN]** - Something unexpected but continuing
- üî¥ **[ERROR]** - Failed to complete action
- üü¢ **[DONE]** - Success!

### Step 3: Review Screenshots

After a failed attempt, check the screenshots in your project root:

```bash
ls -la debug-*.png
```

Open them to see:
- Is the page fully loaded?
- Is the add-to-cart button visible?
- Are there any popups or overlays blocking elements?
- Is the user logged in?

### Step 4: Check Button/Input Logs

When an element can't be found, the logs will show what WAS found:

```
[WARN] [barbora] Found 12 buttons on page
[INFO] [barbora] Button 0: "Sutinku"
[INFO] [barbora] Button 1: "Prisijungti"
[INFO] [barbora] Button 2: "U≈ædaryti"
```

This helps you understand what selectors to add.

### Step 5: Fix Selectors

If you identify the correct selector from the screenshots/logs, you can add it to the driver files:

**For Barbora** - Edit `lib/drivers/barbora.ts`:
```typescript
const barboraSelectors = [
  'button[class*="b-product-action-add"]',
  'YOUR-NEW-SELECTOR-HERE', // Add here
  // ... rest
];
```

**For Rimi** - Edit `lib/drivers/rimi.ts`:
```typescript
const rimiSelectors = [
  'button:has-text("Pridƒóti")',
  'YOUR-NEW-SELECTOR-HERE', // Add here
  // ... rest
];
```

## Common Issues

### Issue: URL with "arba" (or) in it

Your error shows:
```
https://barbora.lt/produktai/saltai-rukyta-kiaulienos-nugarine-pjaustyta-a-r-100-g arba https://barbora.lt/produktai/s-rukyta-kleboniska-nugarine-su-cesnakais-ir-pomid-a-r-100-g
```

This is **two URLs** in one field! The app treats this as a single URL which won't work.

**Fix:** Split into two separate items:
```json
[
  {
    "site": "barbora",
    "url": "https://barbora.lt/produktai/saltai-rukyta-kiaulienos-nugarine-pjaustyta-a-r-100-g"
  },
  {
    "site": "barbora", 
    "url": "https://barbora.lt/produktai/s-rukyta-kleboniska-nugarine-su-cesnakais-ir-pomid-a-r-100-g"
  }
]
```

### Issue: "Could not find search input"

**Possible causes:**
1. Site structure changed
2. User not logged in (some sites hide search when logged out)
3. Geographic restrictions (site might look different from different countries)

**Debug steps:**
1. Check the screenshot - is the search bar visible?
2. Review the input logs - what inputs WERE found?
3. Try logging in manually first (headful mode)
4. Check if a popup/modal is covering the search

### Issue: "Could not find add-to-cart button"

**Possible causes:**
1. Product is out of stock
2. Product requires variant selection (size, flavor, etc.)
3. Site structure changed
4. Button is outside the viewport

**Debug steps:**
1. Check the screenshot - is the button visible?
2. Review the button logs - what buttons WERE found?
3. Try the URL manually in a browser
4. Try using a query instead of the direct URL

## Advanced: Using Browser DevTools

If headful mode is enabled, you can interact with the browser window:

1. Right-click ‚Üí "Inspect Element"
2. Find the add-to-cart button or search input
3. Check its attributes (class, id, data-testid, etc.)
4. Add those selectors to the driver files

## Getting More Help

If you're still stuck:

1. **Share the screenshots** - Visual evidence is key
2. **Share the logs** - Copy the relevant error logs
3. **Share the URL** - Some products might have unique issues
4. **Try a different product** - Verify if it's product-specific or site-wide

## Cleaning Up Debug Files

Screenshots accumulate over time. To clean them up:

```bash
# Remove all debug screenshots
rm debug-*.png

# Or remove old ones (macOS/Linux)
find . -name "debug-*.png" -mtime +7 -delete
```

**Remember:** Web scraping is fragile! Sites change their HTML frequently. The debugging features help you adapt quickly when things break.
